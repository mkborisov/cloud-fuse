.SH NAME
CloudFUSE \- mount dropbox storage as a local drive
.SH SYNOPSIS
cloud_fuse.py [MNTDIR, RESTRDIR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
CloudFUSE is a Python script that implements a file system in user space using FUSE.
It's called CloudFUSE because the file system's primary feature is file synchronisation
with the cloud, which enables it to mount Dropbox storage as a local drive.
.SH OPTIONS
CloudFUSE takes the following options
\*n -h, --help       show this help message and exit
\*n -d, --debug      turn on fuse debug output
\*n -s, --nothreads  disallow multi-threaded operation / run on a single thread
.SH SEE ALSO
fuse(8), mount(2), mount(8), fusermount(1)
.SH BUGS
Thereâ€™s an issue with Dropbox metadata API call. It always returns 0 bytes for folder size, 
so non-empty directories currently show up to be of size 0 bytes.
